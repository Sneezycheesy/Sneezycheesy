Hello there.
My name is Joshua, but you can call me Josh, or use my online alias "Sneezycheesy".

I am getting very interested in embedded systems and kernel hacking at the moment,
I want to learn both these skills, but I'm on a late and slow start so it's going to take a minute...
I want there to be 40 hours in a day for this, Geez.

Let's meet some day, for now though: Have a good one.

Cheers,
Josh
